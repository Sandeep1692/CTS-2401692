### Security Note

- Ensure sensitive information, such as API keys, is encrypted or stored securely. Avoid committing them directly to version control. Use environment variables or secret management tools instead.
- Example: Replace `API KEY NASA:- LzIH3vcTygRNA3L6IfrSMhUeMfeURMBrTq1hC8KJ` with an encrypted placeholder or reference to a secure storage location.
